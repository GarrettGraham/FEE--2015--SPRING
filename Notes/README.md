# General Policies and Procedures

## Timeliness

According to official policy, if you miss more than 4 lectures you'll forfeit placement support. What's more, this class moves _extremely_ quickly, so any absence will be hard to make up. Finally, please respect everyone by arriving on time and ready to start promptly at 09:00 am every day. If you must be tardy, please contact Susanna directly and notify the class via HipChat, but also note that we count 2 tardies -- more than 15 minutes late -- as an absence.

## Homework

Typically, homework is due by 08:00 AM the day after assignment, e.g. an assignment given on Tuesday afternoon is due Wednesday morning no later than 08:00 AM. End-of-week assignments are assigned on Thursday afternoon, are usually much larger in scope, and are due at 08:00 AM on the following Monday. Atypical assignments will clearly state the turn-in requirements.

Many of the assignments will seem larger than you can complete in the time allotted. This is intentional. Part of your job will be to dissect and prioritize pieces of the assignment and apply time constraints to your work to ensure that you complete _some_ of _every part_ of each assignment. Complete attempts will be given more leeway than incomplete perfectionism.

## Conduct

You are expected to respect yourself, your work, and the work of others. You may use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copying the work of others is prohibited. Even in team- or pair-based exercises, each person is expected to contribute his or her own work. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.

Please conduct yourself with mutual respect for the others in your class. This should be considered a workplace with no room for NSFW material. If something said or done to you, about you, or around you offends you or makes you uncomfortable, please inform a staff member immediately. If you do not feel comfortable speaking to a local staffer, everyone is in HipChat, and our email addresses are publicly available.

**We believe firmly in the mutual respect and dignity of everyone on our team, and students are a part of that team.**
