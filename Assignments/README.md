# Turn-in Instructions

These are the bare minimal instructions you should follow for every assignment. Additional instructions or direction may be provided in the assignment file, but always ensure that you follow these steps.

* Create a **Work In Progress (WIP) Issue** in _this_ repository for every assignment
    * Name it according to the assignment name with your name appended, e.g. `00 -- Brace Yourself -- David Rogers`
    * If tasks (i.e. check boxes) are provided for you in the assignment file, include them as the _description_ of your WIP Issue
    * If tasks are _not_ provided for you (as in later assignments), create your own; you will be expected to break down many assignments on your own
    * Estimate the complexity, difficulty, and risk of each major piece of the assignment with T-shirt sizes: Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Extra Large (XL)
* _Check off tasks as you finish to demonstrate progress_; note the progress bar in [the Issues list](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2015--SPRING/issues) for each issue
* Create a new _topic_ branch in your `TIY-Assignments` repository for the assignment
    * Name the branch according to the assignment, e.g. `00--Brace-Yourself`
    * Ensure that you commit _all_ your work into that branch _only_
    * Push that branch to Github regularly to show progress
* Open a Pull Request (PR) from your topic branch to `master`
    * [Add a link to your **WIP Issue**](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#references) in a comment on your Pull Request
    * Note that the PR will update automatically as you push more work to the branch
    * Do this step _as soon as you have a commit_; don't wait until the due date!
