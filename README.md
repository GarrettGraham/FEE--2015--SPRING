## Hello and welcome to Front End Engineering!

I hope you're excited about this new possibility, this turning point in your career. I am. I'm really looking forward to meeting each of you in person and getting to know you better over the course of the upcoming 12 weeks. I'm also really excited about teaching and mentoring you all and seeing what awesome things you'll build and what interesting ways you'll approach the assignments and projects in the class.

To get started, we'll be using [Github](http://github.com) extensively. You need to [sign up for a free Github account](http://github.com/signup), find [the class project](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2015--SPRING) and "star" it ([more on "starring" and notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars)), so that I know who to give access. Once you're added, follow the instructions in [Assignment 00](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2015--SPRING/blob/master/Assignments/00--Brace-Yourself.md), which is _due the first day of class_.

In the class project in Github, you'll notice a few different directories. Please take some time to read through the `README.md` files in each. Throughout the course, I'll be adding files to this repository to distribute assignments, notes for each class, and general information about the course. Throughout the course, you'll open, close, and contribute to Issues and Pull Requests ([more about "issues" on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues)). If you have any questions about any of the content, please [open an Issue](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2015--SPRING/issues), and I'll attempt to answer you promptly.

Thanks,
